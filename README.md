# feature-finder
Uses Spotipy library to find every artist featured on a given artists discography on Spotify.

This project is in its early stages, and mostly involves experimentation with the Spotipy library. 
Future plans include the creation of a graph (much like the one in this video about Wikipedia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JheGL6uSF-4) that relates artists on Spotify by feature.
